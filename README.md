In this Power BI project, a comprehensive sales dataset was utilized to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard. The data transformation process was performed in Power Query, where various techniques such as column transformation, adding custom columns, merging and appending queries, grouping data, and others were applied to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. Relationships were established between the tables to enable cross-functional reporting, and advanced DAX functions were implemented to create new measures and calculated columns, which provided flexibility and ease in evaluating key performance metrics. This preparatory work enabled accurate and dynamic data modeling tailored to specific analytical needs.

The final dashboard presents an insightful overview of sales performance through a variety of visual elements including matrix tables, bar charts, cards, filters, pie and donut charts, line and stacked column charts. It highlights total profit, total revenue, total orders, and target revenue by weekly status, offering comparisons between actual and target values. The dashboard further provides ranking of countries by revenue, and visual breakdowns of sales and profit by product, continent, region, occupation, and gender. These elements work together to deliver a fully interactive and user-friendly reporting experience, allowing stakeholders to derive actionable insights and make data-driven decisions.
